# PirateGBA
This is a Gameboy Advance game I wrote for one of my classes (CS2110) in C. The main logic is located in the "logicCode" folder while the "imageCode" and "images" folders contain the data to draw the game images and the images themselves, repsectively.

# Running the game
The "Yar.gba" file can be run by opening it in a GBA emulator. For testing, I used VisualBoyAdvance.
